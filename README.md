# odin-recipes

In this project, I create a website displaying food recipes using only HTML. 

The website consists of a main index page, which will link to a separate page for each recipe. 

Utilizing basic HTML skills such as heading, paragraphs, text formatting, lists. 

Also used to get used to git and terminal commands to create directories, files, and to add, commit, push code to github.
